**Project Name: Expanding Cards**

**Description:**
In this project, we'll create expanding cards using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These expanding cards will have background images and headings, styled using Flexbox for alignment. When clicked, the cards will expand smoothly with the help of CSS transitions. The heading will only appear once the card is fully expanded. While we're using background images and headings in this demonstration, you can customize the content to suit your needs, such as testimonials or FAQs.

**Getting Started:**
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
3. Review the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files provided.
4. Customize the content and styling as desired.
5. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the expanding cards in action.

**Project Structure:**
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the expanding cards.
- `styles.css`: Defines the styles for the expanding cards, including layout and appearance.
- `script.js`: Implements the JavaScript functionality for expanding the cards upon click.
